# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Preparing for the challenge, setting up git and stuff

**Thoughts**: None

**Link(s) to work**: None


### Day 1: August 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've played with classes in python, ran into a few problems with inheriting from superclass, but managed to figure it out

**Thoughts**: It's easier to work with classes using python(instead of Java), no need to use @override and similar syntax.

### Day 2: August 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I started working with pygame library and managed to write a bit of code to display a game window, BUT I ran into problems with pylint having problems with pygame, I found something, that I need to whitelist pygame or add exceptions, but I've not managed to do that yet.

**Thoughts**: I've read that it's basically a VS Code IDE problem, maybe I should use some other IDE when working with pygame. Subllime Text maybe.

### Day 3: August 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the game, added basic images, but more importantly, I started applying OOP practices for this game code.

**Thoughts**: So I downloaded Atom, to work with pygame, no more problems and I like the design of it. Also I started using "Cmder", cmd alternative. It looks nicer and has git integration and I can use unix commands on it, like "ls"

### Day 4: August 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've added keyboard controls to the game, also a background and other images, enemy functionality and border detection.

**Thoughts**: Feels nice to be able to move the character, I'm now thinking about other functionalities I could add to this mini game! Although, I'll need to add enemy collision first.

### Day 5: August 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the game together with the tutorial so no I'm gonna be implementing my own improvements to the game. What tutorial did not cover was the collision of many entities and I'm trying to figure out, how to fix this. I've tried looping on list, but something is not right.

**Thoughts**: I think next improvement should be score tracking and highscore table.

### Day 6: August 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've tried implementing a better solution for checking collision of multiple objects, but failed, so I implemented simpler solution for now. Also, I wanted to improve levels by making speed refresh to that of the first level, after additional entities appear, but I had problems with global variables, somehow it did not track the global variable. I'll have to come back to this later too.

**Thoughts**: To improve level design, I first drew out level/speed table on paper to better visualize difficulty system. This helped me a bit.
